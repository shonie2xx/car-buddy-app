## Info

For this exciting project, I have combined the power of React Native and Arduino to create a cutting-edge car assistant called "Car-buddy". This innovative solution is designed to make your driving experience more convenient and enjoyable. With Car-buddy, you can easily control various aspects of your car using just your voice.

For example, you can say "Hey buddy" to initiate the voice recognition, then command "Turn the lights on/off" or "Set the temperature to 20" to control the car's lights and temperature respectively. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with the Arduino, which in turn controls the hardware.

With Car-buddy, you can enjoy a more comfortable and personalized driving experience, all while keeping your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. It's a great example of how technology can enhance our daily lives.
